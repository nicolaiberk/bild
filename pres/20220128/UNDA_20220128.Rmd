# Can a single media outlet still shape opinions in contemporary news environments?

---

# Conflicting theoretical views I

### Emphasis Framing

- Issue attitudes dependent on considerations in mind `r Cite(bib, "Druckman2001")`.
- These considerations can be altered by the the empasis of different frames in the news media `r Cite(bib, "Nelson1997")`.
- As a result, issue attitudes can be manipulated.

___

__Emphasis framing hypothesis__: 

.center[*If a newspaper emphasises more positive/negative considerations of an issue, the readers’ attitude about the issue becomes more positive/negative*.]

---

# Conflicting theoretical views II

### Selective Exposure

- Modern news environments offer plenty of choice to consumers `r Cite(bib, c("Arceneaux2013", "Bennett2008"))`.
- Viewers seek out attitude-congruent news content `r Cite(bib, c("Iyengar2009", "Taber2006"))`.
- Hence they will change the news outlet if their preferred news outlet changes its slant.

___

__Opt-out hypothesis__: If a newspaper emphasises more positive/negative considerations of an issue, attitude-incongruent readers will stop consuming the newspaper.

---

# Conflicting theoretical views III

### Selective Exposure II

- However, unclear whether consumers seek out different articles or outlets `r Cite(bib, c("Lau2021", "Marquart2016", "Zillich2021"))`.

___

__Selective avoidance hypothesis__: If a newspaper emphasises more positive/negative considerations of an issue, attitude-incongruent readers will continue consuming the newspaper.

- Germany 2015
- declining readership`
- insert quote on lost readership

# Study Design

---

# Study I

Does a change in migration framing lead to changing migration attitudes?

1. Aggregate-level DiD design exploiting change in Bild migration framing.
2. Assessing all changes in migration framing in the major German dailys.
  1. Aggregate DiD-correlations of frame change and opinion change 
  2. Individual-level estimation of news diet and correlation with over-time opinion changes.


---

# Study 2

Does a change in migration framing lead to changes in readership composition?

Assessment of association of initial and current migration attitude with reported readership.

### Finding:

- No association of migration framing and change in migration attitude!
- Instead change in media consumption in response to changes in issue framing?

# Conclusion

---

# Conclusion

- No effects of substantial change in migration framing on issue attitudes.
- No association of changes in migration framing generally with changing issue attitudes.
- No association of sustantial change in migration framing with changing readership behaviour.

__$\rightarrow$ Limited influence of single outlets in diverse media markets!__

---

# Limitations

- Unclear how this translates from tabloids to broadsheets.
- Unclear if salience of migration issue contributed to fixed issue positions.
