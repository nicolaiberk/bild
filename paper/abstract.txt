What are the limits of the news media's ability to shape public opinion? I argue that politicization conditions the responsiveness of individual attitudes to changes in the information environment. Exploiting a rare change in the migration framing of the biggest German tabloid *Bild*, I estimate the precise impact of this shift on immigration attitudes using large-scale panel data. Despite a 42 percent increase of the emphasis of crime in migration coverage, I find a robust null effect on immigration attitudes and a number of related variables. Further analyses suggest that media outlets' ability to manipulate public opinion in the short term seems to be limited to brief opportunity windows during the politicisation of a given issue.
