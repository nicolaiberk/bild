# Emphasis framing effect size in experimental studies

- Generally Framing Effect (always defined as pro vs con condition; better would be control but often not available) highly contingent on context: polarisation and salience of issue (Chong and Druckman 2007, Lecheler, Slothuus & De Vreese 2009, Slothuus & De Vreese 2010), sponsor (Slothuus & De Vreese 2010), Group Appeal (Nelson & Kinder 1996), political knowledge of the exposed (Chong and Druckman 2007b)
- Nelson & Kinder 1996 JoP: NA, because two negative frames with different group appeals
- Slothuus & De Vreese 2010 JoP: 9pp on welfare (conflict), 20pp on trade agreement (not conflict); 18-30pp when sponsored by own party, -5 - 15pp if sponsored by opposing party
- Chong & Druckman 2007 APSR: 30-34pp with one exposure to strong frame, 40 with weak con frame and .37pp with two pro. Low knowledge might moderate under certain conditions (low: .01-.34, high: .31-.37, generally be cautious with this interpretation, as effect tables show ordered probit coefficients)
- Nelson Clawson Oxley 1997 APSR: News frames, but visual treatment (might arguably be good). .53-.65 on seven-point scale, but seem higher in regression table (up to .34)
- Cited in Chong & Druckman 2007 Ann. Rev. Pol. Sci.: Sniderman & Theriault 2004: 40pp, Rasinski 1989: 45pp
- Brief Discussion of proper way to define magnitude of framing effects (conclusion: different standards exist) in Chong & DRuckman 2007 AnnRev p.109, as well as a brief review of framing experiments at the bottom of that page

The magnitude of framing effects differs widely across experiments, and there are good reasons to believe that there is a substantial bias in the selection of . [Brief discussion: definition of how to estimate the magnitude contested (Chong Druckman AnnRev2007) and comparability difficult but lower 10 (Nelson Clawson Oxley, mid 20 Slothuus & De Vreese 2010, the sky is the limit [see below]] Given that several studies report estimates over thirty (Chong and Druckman 2007 APSR), sometimes over fourty pp on a zerot to one scale using simple emphasis framing conditions, I take 10pp of the scale as a conservative expectation of the framing effect.
